- 👋 Hi, I’m @StarTaurus11
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about computers in a more in depth way than I have before.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how hard its going to be to learn more about computers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating useful and helpful products.
- 📫 How to reach me : I would say to just message me on here? (ill correct this if I find that there are no messages on here)  
- 😄 Pronouns: I actually don't know all the choices so I think its He, Him?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I may or may not have some magical capabilities.
